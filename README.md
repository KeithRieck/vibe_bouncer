# vibe_bouncer
This was a very quick test of [Google Antigravity](antigravity.google) for creating a quick app.

1. First Prompt:
    * Create a project in ES2020 and using the Phaser game library that displays 64 small circles that bounce around the screen.  The project should not depend on any server side code and should be execute entirely in a browser.  It should easily display on tablets as well as web browsers.
2. Second Prompt:
    * It should be more object oriented.
        * There should be one Phaser Scene object
    * There should be a Bouncer class that extends the Phaser Sprite class, where Bouncer encapsulates the bouncing behavior.
    * There  should be a Circle class that extends Bouncer.  Later, we may have other Bouncer objects on the screen
